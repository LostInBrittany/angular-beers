      <span>Affligem Blond</span>
      <p>
        Affligem Blonde, the classic clear blonde abbey ale, with a gentle roundness and 6.8% alcohol. 
        Low on bitterness, it is eminently drinkable.

      <span>Affligem Tripel</span>
      <p>
        The king of the abbey beers. It is amber-gold and pours with a deep head and original aroma, 
        delivering a complex, full bodied flavour. Pure enjoyment! Secondary fermentation in the bottle.
