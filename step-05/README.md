# AngularBeer - AngularJS tutorial - Step 05 #

Enough of building an app with five beers in a hard-coded dataset! Let's fetch a larger dataset from our server using one of Angular's built-in services called `HttpModule`. We will use Angular's dependency injection (DI) to provide the service to the `beerList.component` controller.


## Data ##

Our new dataset is now a list of 11 beers stored in JSON format in the `beers/beers.json` file in your project.
This file is available from the server at the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/beers/beers.json

`beers/beers.json`:

```json
[
  ...
  {
    "alcohol": 6.8,
    "description": "A reddish-brown abbey ale brewed with dark malts. The secondary fermentation gives a fruity aroma and a unique spicy character with a distinctive aftertaste. Secondary fermentation in the bottle.",
    "id": "AffligemDubbel",
    "img": "beers/img/AffligemDubbel.jpg",
    "name": "Affligem Dubbel"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Controller ##

We'll use Angular's [HttpModule](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/server-communication.html) service in our controller to make an HTTP request to your web server to fetch the data in the `beers/beers.json` file.
`HttpModule` is just one of several built-in modules that handle common operations in web apps.
Angular injects these services for you where you need them.

Dependency injection helps to make your web apps both well-structured (e.g., separate components for presentation, data, and control) and loosely coupled (dependencies between components are not resolved by the components themselves, but by the DI subsystem).

`HttpModule` makes an HTTP GET request to our web server, asking for `beers/beers.json` (the url is relative to our `index.html` file). The server responds by providing the data in the JSON file. (The response might just as well have been dynamically generated by a backend server. To the browser and our app they both look the same. For the sake of simplicity we used a JSON file in this tutorial.)

The HttpModule service returns a [Promise ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) with a success method. We call this method to handle the asynchronous response and assign the beer data to the scope controlled by this controller, as a model called `beers`. Notice that Angular detected the JSON response and parsed it for us!

To use a service in Angular, you simply declare the names of the dependencies you need as arguments to the controller's constructor function, as follows:

`app/app.module.ts` :

```typescript
import {NgModule} from "@angular/core";
import {BrowserModule} from "@angular/platform-browser";
import {FormsModule} from "@angular/forms";
import { HttpModule, JsonpModule }  from '@angular/http';
import {BeerList} from "./beerlist/beerList.component";
import {FilterArrayPipe} from "./pipes/filter-array-pipe";
import {OrderByPipe} from "./pipes/orderby-pipe";

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        FormsModule,
        JsonpModule,
        HttpModule
    ],
    declarations: [
        BeerList,
        FilterArrayPipe,
        OrderByPipe
    ],
    bootstrap: [BeerList]
})
export class AppModule {
}
```

`app/beers.service.ts` :

```typescript
import {Injectable} from "@angular/core";
import {Http, Response} from "@angular/http";
import "rxjs/add/operator/toPromise";

@Injectable()
export class BeerService {
    // URL to web API
    private beerUrl = 'beers/beers.json';

    constructor(private http: Http) {
    }

    getBeers(): Promise<any[]> {
        return this.http.get(this.beerUrl)
            .toPromise()
            .then(this.extractData)
            .catch(this.handleError);
    }

    private extractData(res: Response) {
        let body = res.json();
        return body || [];
    }

    private handleError(error: any) {
        // In a real world app, we might use a remote logging infrastructure
        // We'd also dig deeper into the error to get a better message
        let errMsg = (error.message) ? error.message : error.status ? `${error.status} - ${error.statusText}` : 'Server error';
        console.error(errMsg); // log to console instead
        return Promise.reject(errMsg);
    }
}
```

`app/beerlist/beerList.component.ts` :

```typescript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {FilterArrayPipe} from '../pipes/filter-array-pipe';
import {OrderByPipe} from '../pipes/orderby-pipe';
import { BeerService } from '../beers.service';

@Component({
 selector: 'beer-list',
 templateUrl: './app/beerlist/beerList.html',
 pipes: [FilterArrayPipe, OrderByPipe],
 providers: [BeerService]
})

export class BeerList {
 orderProp = 'alcohol';
 beers = [];
 mode = 'Promise';

 constructor (private beerService: BeerService) {}

 ngOnInit() { this.getBeers(); }

 getBeers() {
     this.beerService.getBeers()
         .then(
             beers => {this.beers = beers; console.log(beers)},
             error =>  this.errorMessage = <any>error);
 }

}
```


Angular's dependency injector provides services to your controller when the controller is being constructed. The dependency injector also takes care of creating any transitive dependencies the service may have (services often depend upon other services).

## Experiments ##

At the bottom of `app/beerlist/beerList.html`, add a `<pre>{{beers | json}}</pre>` binding to see the list of beers displayed in json format.

At the top of `app/beerlist/beerList.html`, add a

```html
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" *ngIf="errorMessage">
  <strong>Oh snap!</strong> {{errorMessage}}.
</div>
```

to display an error message, you can test if by modifying the `beerUrl` in `app/beers.service.ts`.

In the BeerList component, pre-process the http response by limiting the number of beers to the first 5 in the list.
Use the following code in the `getBeers` callback:

```typescript
getBeers() {
    this.beerService.getBeers()
        .then(
            beers => { this.beers = beers.splice(0, 5); },
            error =>  this.errorMessage = <any>error);
}
```

## Summary ##

Now that you have learned how easy it is to use Angular services (thanks to Angular's dependency injection), go to [step 6](../step-06), where you will add some thumbnail images of beers and some links.
